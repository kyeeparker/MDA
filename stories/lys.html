            <h4>Lysandrade Valois Delacroix</h4>
            <h1>Étienne Valois and Isolde Delacroix</h1>
            <h2>The Dance Between the Swan and Melancholy</h2>
            <h3>Étienne Valois, born in June 10, 1971, was a man who loved art but could not stand the artist. An opera critic and member of the French nobility, he attended the most refined balls, where he admired the finest performances and savored the most exquisite delicacies. He valued art above all else, especially when it translated melancholy, emotions, and human feelings into pure expression.</h3>
            <h3>In 19, at the age of 28, he met Isolde Delacroix, a 24-year-old ballerina born in November 26, 1975, celebrated for her grace and delicacy. Known as the "White Swan," she enchanted audiences with her ethereal femininity. Her skin was porcelain—fragile and luminous; her eyes, blue as the purest moonlight; her hair, golden like the finest gold. She danced with excellence, harmonious and perfect—as if every gesture, every sigh, every smile had been meticulously sculpted by divine hands.</h3>
            <h3>Yet behind that delicate façade hid a calculating, cold woman. Upon discovering the Valois family’s prestige, Isolde moved with surgical precision to infiltrate their ranks. Every interaction with Étienne—every word, every glance, every smile—was carefully planned. Even the birth of her immaculate daughter was part of her game.</h3>
            <h3>Behind the mask of the White Swan, Isolde concealed a voracious narcissism, a histrionic personality, and traits of possible Antisocial Personality Disorder (ASPD). She adapted flawlessly to Étienne’s life: she said what he wanted to hear, dressed as he desired—even though he never expressed his preferences. She simply knew.</h3>
            <h3>She got what she wanted: she married Étienne, and months later, announced her pregnancy. It was then that her mask began to crumble. Her behavior became impulsive, destructive, and violent. There was no longer any reason for restraint—she already carried the final piece of her chessboard in her womb: the immaculate child.</h3>
            <h3>When she learned it would be a girl, her satisfaction was immense. A boy was inconceivable—only a daughter could be the reincarnation of her legacy.</h3>
            <h3>On March 4, 2009, Lysandrade Valois Delacroix was born in a bloody, anesthesia-free delivery—Isolde had refused any intervention that would "taint the purity of the moment." Upon seeing the child for the first time, she sighed in relief and murmured: "A swan..." Her violet eyes, pale skin, and white hair confirmed her vision. She was perfect.</h3>
            <h3>Étienne, watching from afar, felt a chill down his spine. He already knew: that child would be just another work of art in Isolde’s hands.</h3>
            <h3>In her early years, Lys lived in a world of luxury—the finest clothes, the most refined environments, seemingly perfect care. But when her cognitive faculties developed, around age 5, Isolde began teaching her that empathy was a script, something to be used only when convenient. Every action, every gesture, every word had to be calculated. Lys had to be perfect.</h3>
            <h3>Meanwhile, Étienne grew increasingly distant. He was never close to his daughter, never protected her from her mother’s manipulations. To him, Lys was just "another one of Isolde’s artworks." Until Lys found letters—written by him to a mistress, someone he planned to escape with, to start anew far from that life.</h3>
            <h3>(Their marriage had been cold for years. What Étienne didn’t know was that the mistress was another of Isolde’s inventions—a trap to keep him bound, away from any true happiness. When he discovered it, he fell into a deep depression.)</h3>
            <h3>On January 27, 2016, Lys’s 12th birthday, Étienne took her for a walk, saying they needed "some fresh air." But their true destination was the subway tracks in front of the Palais Garnier.</h3>
            <h3>Before leaving, he left a note in Lys’s coat pocket:</h3>
            <h3>"Forgive me, Lyssandrade. You are the only beautiful thing I ever created."</h3>
            <h3>Lys saw everything.</h3>
            <h3>But the letter never reached her hands. Isolde found it and burned it. Lys would never know that, in his final moment, her father had considered her something truly beautiful.</h3>
            <h3>Even after the incident, Isolde continued showing Lys photos of her husband’s corpse. To her, it would make her daughter resilient—even teach her a lesson:</h3>
            <h3>"See? This is what happens when we grow attached," she declared.</h3>
            <h3>Lys, looking at the photos of her dead father, felt nothing—and for the first time, she wondered:</h3>
            <h3>"Why can’t I feel anything?"</h3>
            <h3>Years passed. Now 16, Lys began dancing ballet to please her mother. Her routine became even more exhausting, chasing unattainable perfection. Isolde grew increasingly rigid and cruel, teaching beyond what she knew. Lys began to atrophy; no human was made to endure so much.</h3>
            <h3>During fouetté drills, Lys fell repeatedly due to the dance’s complexity. Her mother screamed at her, cursed, and said:</h3>
            <h3>"You’re ruining my life!"</h3>
            <h3>On the last fall, Isolde, in a violent impulse, began kicking her on the ground. In a fit of fury, Lys grabbed her mother’s ballerina trophy and stabbed it into her own right side. She smiled at Isolde and desperately screamed for help.</h3>
            <h3>When paramedics arrived, Lys threw herself into their arms and cried:</h3>
            <h3>"She’s insane! Look what she did to me!"</h3>
            <h3>Every lesson in deception Isolde had taught her worked perfectly. Of course, everyone believed her. Isolde was institutionalized for "psychotic break" and "post-traumatic stress," allegedly triggered by her husband’s suicide.</h3>
            <h3>After the hospitalization, Lys visited her mother only once. Isolde, full of resentment, refused to speak—until her daughter whispered in her ear:</h3>
            <h3>"How does it feel knowing you trained a daughter better than you?"</h3>
            <h3>Isolde exploded in rage. Lys pretended to cry and left the room, saying:</h3>
            <h3>"I just want my mother back..."</h3>
            <h3>Two years later, Lys enrolled in the prestigious Saint Laurent University, founded by Napoleon Bonaparte and reformed by Louis XVI. She studied psychology (ironically) and handled academic life well—nothing could drain her energy more than her mother already had.</h3>
            <h3>On January 17, 2028, Lys was walking home when she saw a young man lost in thought. Her selective empathy instinct made her approach:</h3>
            <h3>"Are you okay? You look sad," she asked softly.</h3>
            <h3>The young man confessed he had been rejected by someone he loved and felt empty, as if he had lost a part of himself. Lys, not fully understanding, invited him to sit and talk.</h3>
            <h3>After a long dialogue, she noticed a red ribbon in his hand and asked:</h3>
            <h3>"I didn’t know you wore ribbons, Mr...?"</h3>
            <h3>He laughed:</h3>
            <h3>"Hahaha, I don’t. It was a gift for the one I’d give my heart to... but I’ll throw it away."</h3>
            <h3>Lys replied:</h3>
            <h3>"You shouldn’t throw your fraction away, much less the symbol of your heart. Some people need that."</h3>
            <h3>The young man looked at her and the ribbon:</h3>
            <h3>"You’re right. Do you want it?"</h3>
            <h3>Lys refused, but he insisted:</h3>
            <h3>"Red looks beautiful on you, Miss...?"</h3>
            <h3>"Lys. You can call me Lys."</h3>
            <h3>He handed her the ribbon and added:</h3>
            <h3>"I never noticed your eyes before... they’re beautiful."</h3>
            <h3>Lys felt something strange—embarrassment? A feeling beyond her control was inconceivable. She grabbed the ribbon and abruptly said goodbye:</h3>
            <h3>"Thank you, but I have to go."</h3>
            <h3>Upon arriving home, she knelt on the floor, bewildered:</h3>
            <h3>"What the hell was that?"</h3>
            <h3>Her face was wet. She was crying. How could something so small, someone so insignificant, provoke that? She hadn’t cried for her father’s death, nor for her wronged mother... why now?</h3>
            <h3>She looked at the ribbon tossed by the bed, crawled to it, and tied it behind her head. In the mirror, she tried to smile through tears but couldn’t contain the emotion. She was human—and finally allowed herself to feel.</h3>
            <h3>"I need to feel that again..."</h3>
