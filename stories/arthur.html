            <h4>Arthur Cruz da Viera</h4>
            <h1>Maria de Fátima Cruz Da Viera and Gael Cruz da Viera</h1>
            <h2>And their perfect little boy</h2>
            <h3>A Brazilian, born in Londrina, Paraná, on January 27, 2007, was a happy child. His mother, Maria de Fátima Cruz Da Vieira, a strong woman married to Gael Cruz Da Vieira, took care of the house and their son while the father worked tirelessly to provide for them—keeping them well-fed and living a comfortable life overall.</h3>
            <h3>From a young age, Arthur was very clever, always wanting to help his mother with daily chores. He was a natural troublemaker, but with a good heart. He loved when his mother told him bedtime stories, adored bossa nova music, dark chocolate, Neapolitan ice cream (but without the chocolate), and had a passion for horses, nature, and art.</h3>
            <h3>As a child, Arthur painted and drew all over the house. His parents never scolded him, especially his mother. She said his drawings "brought life and color to the house" and that one day, they would also bring "memories." Little is known about his father—he was practically nonexistent at home, not for any bad reason, but his absence still brought much sadness and longing to his son.</h3>
            <h3>Arthur always tried to help his mother. Since he was very little, he sold drawings to people on the street. Being a child, people bought them out of pity, wanting to help. But over time, he improved, always with his mother’s support. Arthur drew what he saw and loved—his friends, landscapes, his dreams, and his mother.</h3>
            <h3>Arthur dreamed of one day living in a castle with his mother and father. He wanted to give them the fruits of a peaceful life full of love. His mother always called him "Mommy’s little prince," saying that one day he might have his castle—but it should be with a beautiful princess who loved him as much as she loved his father.</h3>
            <h3>On the rare occasions he saw his father, Arthur would always make him a drawing to keep as a memento during his long work trips. It might not have seemed like it, but his father loved him deeply. While searching for an even better job in Brazil’s big cities, his father found a prestigious company dealing in refined materials that exported directly to France. Nervous during his interview with the CEO, he dropped his wallet on the floor. Before he could pick everything up, the boss noticed the drawing inside.</h3>
            <h3>"Did you make this?" asked the boss.</h3>
            <h3>"No, it was my son, sir."</h3>
            <h3>"He has talent. He must take after his father." He laughed nervously.</h3>
            <h3>"Have you ever considered investing in him? We’ve been needing real artists lately."</h3>
            <h3>"I can’t, sir. I work just to support my family. I’d like to spend more time with him while also giving him a decent life."</h3>
            <h3>"I can help you with that," the CEO assured him.</h3>
            <h3>After the job interview (which went very well thanks to his efforts and vast experience in practically everything!), the boss suggested the idea of recommending Arthur for a prestigious university in the South of France, where an artistic career was highly valued. The university was public, and with what the father earned, he could afford a small apartment there. The CEO even offered to cover travel expenses.</h3>
            <h3>"I can’t accept this," the father replied nervously.</h3>
            <h3>"I’m not asking for him to go. That boy will go to France and become a great artist. You, so new to the company, are already one of my best employees. I see in you a good heart—one that wants only the best for your family. This is a gift you’ve earned through your hard work and what you’ve done for my company."</h3>
            <h3>After some time, when Gael returned home—something he rarely did, appearing only a handful of times a year—his son Arthur had grown up. His personality remained the same as when he was a child: a handsome, charming boy and still a wonderful son. His father arrived with the news, but at first, Arthur refused.</h3>
            <h3>The idea of being far from his mother was unbearable to Arthur. He loved her more than anything. But she comforted him herself.</h3>
            <h3>"You need to think about what’s best for you, son," Maria said, her voice trembling with emotion.</h3>
            <h3>"But Mom, I need you," he replied, still in denial.</h3>
            <h3>"My prince, Mommy can manage. Your father is earning well now, we’re living comfortably, and we’ll see each other many times again. This is a chance for your dream—for me to see my boy creating his art, his colors. I want to see you start your dream. Don’t you remember the castle?"</h3>
            <h3>"That’s just a childish dream, Mom. I don’t want to be apart from you."</h3>
            <h3>"No dream is just childish, Arthur. Dreams are dreams. Go, invest in your future. Do this for your mother, your father, and most of all, for yourself."</h3>
            <h3>After a while, Arthur gave in to the idea of leaving everything behind and starting a fine arts degree at the prestigious University of Saint Laurent in the South of France. The departure was painful—everyone cried at the boarding gate. His father, not much of a talker, hugged his son with pride. Now he earned well and could be home more often to stay with his wife. And the most painful goodbye: his mother looked at him with so much love and already missed him terribly.</h3>
            <h3>"I’ll come back, Mom. I promise."</h3>
            <h3>"I know you will, my love. Call me whenever you need to."</h3>
            <h3>"I will, Mom. You’ll always be my queen."</h3>
            <h3>"And you’ll always be my prince."</h3>
